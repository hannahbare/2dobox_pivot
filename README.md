# Turn idea-box into 2DoBox

For this project we were given code from a pair of classmates that created idea box. We were instructed to pivot the project into another project, were we created a platform that houses a to-do list. We also added new features including better ux/iu design of disabling the save button when there is insufficient information in inputs as well as created a completed check button for when the user has finished the task.
